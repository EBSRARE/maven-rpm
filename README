This is a simple helloworld web archive (war) project.

That illustrates the use of maven rpm plugin to build a 
simple automated deployment with RPM and puppet.

The basic things like register yum repo and install the helloworld rpm
from that repo is done by puppet. The dependencies of the helloworld rpm
like java and tomcat are managed by the rpm specification in the pom.xml
file with the maven rpm plugin. 

This is a minimal puppet approach the rpm dependencies could also be managed
by puppet.

Required:
 - rpm (install with apt-get install rpm)
 - vagrant (optional to test the puppet deployment) (install with apt-get install vagrant)
 - puppet
 - CentOS64_201307 (self created base box)
 

Let's start.

1) clone this repository
2) download base box for vagrant (could take some minutes the first time, if the download was 
   successfull it is stored local) do it only one time
   $ vagrant box add CentOS64_201307 https://raw.github.com/pussinboots/basebox/master/CentOS64_201307
3) $ vagrant up
4) $ vagrant ssh
5) (ssh on helloworld machine)
   $ wget localhost:8080/helloworld
   >result should be
   <html><body>Hello World from rpm package</body></html>
6) (ssh on apache machine)
   $ wget localhost
   >result should be
   <h1>Hello from a Vagrant VM</h1>
